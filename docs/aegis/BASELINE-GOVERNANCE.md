# Baseline Governance

## 1. Architecture Defect
A confirmed error, gap, or contradiction IN the baseline itself.
- Fix baseline first, then align implementation to corrected baseline.
- Do NOT patch implementation around a defective baseline.

## 2. Architecture Drift
Implementation has deviated from a confirmed, correct baseline.
- Return to baseline via the simplest path.
- Do NOT "update baseline to match drift" without explicit review.

## 3. Baseline Check Protocol
Before non-trivial changes:
1. Read the latest baseline snapshot in `baseline/`
2. Compare current code structure against ownership map
3. Compare current contracts against contract inventory
4. Check for new anti-patterns not recorded in known list
5. Report: aligned / minor drift (self-correctable) / material drift (needs review)

## 4. Architecture Review - 7 Dimensions
After each non-trivial change:
1. **Ownership integrity** - every component has exactly one canonical owner
2. **Module boundaries** - no unauthorized cross-module coupling
3. **Contract changes** - all API/signature/behavior contract changes documented
4. **Cascade proliferation** - no new cascading dependency chains
5. **Dependency direction** - dependencies flow toward stability
6. **Retirement completeness** - old owners/fallbacks/paths removed or scheduled
7. **Entropy flow** - net complexity decreased or stayed; no unjustified new entities

## 5. Hard Boundaries
- BASELINE-GOVERNANCE.md is the constitution for THIS project's Aegis workspace
- Baseline snapshots in `baseline/` are evidence, not authority
- ADRs in `adr/` record decisions; they do not replace baseline governance
- This file is NEVER auto-updated - changes require explicit user review
